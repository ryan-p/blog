title: The first to use libcurl
---

<body>
<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>I began to use libcurl yesterday. My idea is that I want to use libcurl in my program to download something from a website. I coded with the help of some guide on-line. When I finished my coding, I compiled and got the binary executable file. I ran it and got a file as I intened. But the size of the file is 0 byte!</p>

<p>So I began to debug to find out what is the problem. Finally I found it out this morning! It was a very basic mistake... When I passed an argument (a CURL handle) into the function I designed to init a CURL connection, I used the "call-by-value" style, which actually made everything I did in the function invisible outside, so the value of the handler I passed to the function is always "NULL". So when I use "curl_easy_perform", it did nothing.</p>

<p>This is the first story happened in my journey of "developing something for my master's degree. Best wishes for myself, haha </p>
